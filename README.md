# Salvete! 
### Sydney's quite milquetoast, so I do find the transition daunting. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on StoryScape, a human-computer interaction device that facilitates interactive, collaborative storytelling through NLP APIs. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning non-NMF algorithms, which are quite tedious.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on embedded system projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the mathematics underlying machine learning models.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about history, politics, and the like. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ping me on GitHub.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak a few eclectic languages and detest getting drenched while donning a formal attire.
